Through a mixture of circulating light beams combined with the Casimir effect a photonics application to frequency and sound magnetism and sonics be applied to ultrasound non invasive surgeries to aide in the reversal of complications due to a contusion or concussion.  
The reversal of animation coinciding with the brains capacity to heal would exist within the principles of a stress relief on the brain existing to counteract any damage incurred with the structure of the brain being multifaceted enough to protect myelin sheaths destroy amyloid plaques refurbish crucial tissues combat brain scarring and tumours counteract tumourigenesis adjust dopamine and seratonin adhere to regulation of cannaboid receptors protect synapse connections as well as perfect brain spikes seen on graphs.
in addition stem cell integration to counteract and repair damage and act with scaffolds for regenerative Medicine as well as rejuvenation and reanimation of cells see also resuscitation
Seeing the capacity of  current trends in Medicine Law and Mathematics it would go to follow that certain Pharmacology would be designed 
These are conceptual theorizations
