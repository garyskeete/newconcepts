Concept
The transfer of details and power in translating the speed and accuracy of a modern day search engine to a futuristic display of engine output in rocket science

Sound does travel at high frequencies Whether by volume or loudness is measurable due to the allowance of the measurement of those frequencies at a high pitch and inaudible

The combination of the two concepts enables the user to utilize theories of frequencies involved in the juxtaposition and management of a rocket engine built from search engines capabilities speed and accuracy
Frequencies allowed for the management of rocket systems be disabling of rocket systems be power of rocket systems the whereabouts of rocket systems the sound in the universe be tracing of gravitational waves indefinitely 
Power and duration of those frequencies being enabler's for change listening devices sonic devices for high-speed transfer through outerspace for high-speed transport through outerspace for commingling with wormholes for teleportation

Concepts continued
The reach is in the medical field computer rocket science and financial security and technology as well as automotive aviation and military legal as well as scientific arts and music communications and technical knowledge.
In the medical field to reach is ever present in psychiatry anatomy physiology psychology and surgery in fields of cancer research heart research dental applications for mouth cancers the idea of medicine being far reaching for knee surgeries for body frequencies for brain surgeries be application being that the overall far-reaching implications of the frequency modulation and the wormhole application being able to teleport back in time to reach a patient that needed the surgery yesterday or to target a tumor an ailment or HIV with teleported sequences of frequency modulated nanotechnology nanomedicine and molecular mechanisms the application of frequencies to do with wormholes in this application being a medical technology.
For a computer application search Engine would work with holographic sequences of displays to describe pronounce and locate whereabouts of time I located sequences in time forward and backward for a time machine like sequencing with holograms to produce an affect of world time zone integration to relate to the space station with a reverse faxing of timelines for suspended animation of anatomy from aging
In rocket science the frequencies would be aligned with the search engine mechanism in computers to modulate the rest of the rocket be speed the accuracy of detail in the rocket at the collaboration with details of direction of force of Time of velocity of the overall forces in physics act upon the rocket and the directional control speed the displacement as well as looking at the mechanisms of control over a search computerized at that speed allocated to a rocket engine output.
In financial deep properties of the search engine would allow for the disposition of funds over a allocated course of direction be aspect of following the frequency of the stock market of following the frequency of trends in business sales marketing and trends and social media Twitter Facebook and the output of traffic and mailing lists on the Internet
For security the allocation of a time lapsed detail of secured events when it comes to securing passwords or securing voice activated sequences to do with frequencies of the voice frequencies of the mind frequencies of music sound sonics and vocabluary
The aspect of automotive security the look at the frequencies of engine display displacement in cars to do with computerized search engines the engine diagnostics the speed of the engine the details of duration of engine displacement the aspect of utilizing frequencies instead of gas for never-ending energy.
In aviation a sonic weapon a frequency of a frequency activated rocket system for military aircraft a frequency activated communication system a frequency activated ejection seat a frequency activated parachute opener
In military a sonic weapon a sonic cannon a frequency allocated communication system a frequency allocated computerized search system a frequency allocated whereabouts system search and destroy for Sams for rocketry for cannons for guns
Legal safe application of computerized search engines for the justification of probing the minds of people with mens rea modus operandi actus reus the activation of frequencies to correct sequence of PTSD of finding of not guilty after plea
Arts the application of a sonic device without a computerized search that can draw pictures at the speed of computation the speed of a search Engine search at the application of modern art of abstract art
Music the allocation of a sonic device that can computerize music faster than the speed of light and replay by the sequences of music that are natural and soothing in a related progression to go back-and-forth along the timeline to search for correct music to play according to the mental state of the listener
Communications the aspect of a communications device due to the relay of sonics involved in the translation of languages over a given distance be application of whole messages being relayed through a sonic device that is computerized and faster than the speed of light in computation for a relay of information sent all around the globe to various distances and frequencies allocated for personal use and details of sounds music video pictures at details in a secure environment
