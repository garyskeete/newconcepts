Concepts of the Universe and Heavens1

Interfacing of time travel concepts with a clock that has holographic potential for encompassing a given area the holographic potential to do with the freezing or the slowing down of the mechanism of time due to be adaptation of reversal of a fax with a computerized interface readout and effects ; through timelines being observed be adaptation of the creation of a backward motion of observance and detailed calculation of collaboration , collection of details involved in the constraints of the envelopment of the timeline
 To reverse the effects of time in the space station by coaligning the reversal holographically of the worlds timelines with the inner holographic interface of area within the station in a life sustaining manner.
