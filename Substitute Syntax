It's the haematology or the blood transfer the blood circulation that carries the metastasis of malignancy the mutations and be tumourigenesis and tumours throughout the body distributing them and infecting different organs cells and tissues throughout the body multiple myeloma is the multiplication of white blood cells uncontrollably when in the body Upon controlling that tendency  by isolating  and identifying the gene responsible you can control the tendency by inducing genetic control over the function causing the multiplication so a temporary stoppage to multiplication in stages until a balance is found  to multiply one such answer to the imbalance of cells could be the introduction of haemoglobin as the source of red blood cell inference as it is a necessary component to the quality and health of our circulatory system and is one of the factors involved with childhood and adult prevention of ailments and cancers Is it possible a treatment modality could be developed through genetic pathways?
Haemaglobin Calcium and Lactate Dehydrogenase along with factors which induce their characterization and influence their potential in performance and supplication and eventual storage and levelling the white blood cell count producing through inducing a form of Thrombocytopenia that is controlled through genetic pathways the balance for homeostasis.
The reaction involves a hydride ion NADH to the C2 Carbon of Pyruvate to increase Lactate Dehydrogenase
Red blood cells are formed in the red bone marrow of bones. Stem cells in the red bone marrow called hemocytoblasts give rise to all of the formed elements in blood. If a hemocytoblast commits to becoming a cell called a proerythroblast, it will develop into a new red blood cell.
The formation of a red blood cell from hemocytoblast takes about 2 days. The body makes about two million red blood cells every second.
Calcium for bones formed by a temporary mutation in the CASR gene.
Using the CRISPR genetic scissors
* Complete blood count (CBC), which determines the number, size, volume, and hemoglobin content of red blood cells
* Blood iron level and your serum ferritinlevel, the best indicators of your body's total iron stores
* Levels of vitamin B12 and folate, vitamins necessary for red blood cell production
* Special blood tests to detect rare causes of anemia, such as an immune attack on your red blood cells, red blood cell fragility, and defects of enzymes, hemoglobin, and clotting
* Reticulocyte count, bilirubin, and other blood and urine tests to determine how quickly your blood cells are being made or if you have a hemolytic anemia, where your red blood cells have a shortened life span
* Billeted points for Anemia specific to the treatment of the individual for Multiple Myeloma deficiencies.
* Design Medication treatments prophylaxis.
