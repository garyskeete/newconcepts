And so the story goes....
An officer investigating the time transfer of light from one moment in time to the past or future stated that although exact details of he time and place for transmittal were given there was no visible trace of light recorded.
Upon discovery of this scientists fashioned a flashlight for him which he shone on the spot of the transmittal, however this flashlight was special as it recorded simultaneously the trace effects of any previous light on that spot and in doing so picked up what appears to be signals from multiple transmissions and transmittals.

Gary Skeete Seeing that the flashlight involved in the double split experiment allows you to see in scale the time zones with relevance to the earth from the sun through the slits of light which appear as separate entities representing in scale of holographics a measurement of a time zone

Gary Skeete The usage of a preventative mode to stop the access of time travel to superimposed moments in time preventing the destinees becoming Chimeras or superimposing one spot but allowing the superimposition of two qubits that are entangled

Gary Skeete However in the process of organ transferral or synthetic regenerative Biology Chimeras may be permitted as the frequency of usage may make them commonplace

Gary Skeete This is a combined concept across the aspects of Mathematics Medicine Law and physics biology and holographics astronomy and as well would include the various entities such as the Canadian Space agency NASA the Military from across the globe the Institutes of Theoretical Physics CMA AMA Legal and Law enforcement Agencies across the globe and Faculties of Mathematics
