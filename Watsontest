What Watson should display with all concepts ideas and suggestions
If it is a person facial recognition biometrics  DNA and locale Characteristics modus operandi experience complete body scan for discrepancies medical and otherwise speech synthesis and senses acknowledgement physics forces mass acceleration all physics of movement reflex acting upon person
If it is  a place the physics acting upon the environment the temperature the climate the nature the weather the ecosystem flora and fauna geography geology.
If it is a thing the description the mathematics and physics of design the forces involved in ovine or immobility the weight the placement on earth the value

Draw a concept in illustration and act upon it the relevant forces be it DNA elements fire water wood earth wind and all physics involved to predict a percentage of success in it usefulness in given situations globally.
