The systematic proliferation details analysis and deployment of multifactoral multipurpose  multifaceted genetic examples protocol and research oriented works. To display and contribute to the mathematical correlation of the sciences as well as take root in paediatrics through to geriatrics and gerontology. The specifics of aging from gestation to and elderly advanced age can be supplemented with not only quality of care, but a non invasive less stressful less painful way of operation  if necessary an ultrasound with feature built in to transmit holographic tools and instruments for the surgeons hand due to the display being integrated at the molecular genetic and cellular levels. The overall integration and  concepts are  fused by interfaces which in turn synchronize the effects needed to produce a healing application be it automation a diagram of a preferred signalling pathway instruction from a doctorate paper or published article publication or research paper magazine or  book.
The application should alleviate tensions that are pronounced by all involved and lessen the burden of stress.
The knowledge that the non invasive surgery would and could if necessary include magnetism photonics frequencies sonar sonics and medicine as well as vibrations encephalograms and  scaffold building stem cells polymerization and induced apoptosis among the limitless surgical tools being discovered in Holographic's.
