Yes the time reversal with the aspect of augmented reality being the major function big factor in the reality of time reversal from adult to infantry the reversal of ageing process due to animation of illustration due to the functionality of a reversal type of animation attributed to the collaboration of healthy cells within the body stem cell allocation attached to a timing device recording the reversal process and through connected interface produces a reversal in time effect holographically within a virtual reality construct with the application being applied mathematically to age reversal in humans by parallel compatibility and comparison
